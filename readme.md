## High-Speed(about 38 fps) face detector for python:

This a python binding for lib facedetection([https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection))

It is only tested on  raspberry pi 3B which can reach about 38 fps  even faster. Here is the [output](https://github.com/CharlieXie/libfacedetection-python-bindings/tree/master/results)

## How to use

1. You can just download the repo and run test.py which will find right lib according to default version of python

2. Or here is the example

   ```python
   import cv2
   import numpy as np
   # import mat and libfcnn for python2
   from rbp_py2 import mat
   from rbp_py2 import libfcnn
   image = cv2.imread("yourimage.jpg")
   # you can scale down your image to speed up.
   # minimal face which can be detected is 12*12
   # image = cv2.resize(image,(0,0),fx=0.4,fy=0.4)
   rect = libfcnn.inference(mat.Mat.from_array(resized_frame),4)
   # rect is a list of [xmin,ymin,height,weight]
   # now this lib just returns coordinate of the biggest face in the image
   # if no face detected , rect is [0,0,0,0]
   if rect[2]!=0:
    cv2.rectangle(image,(xmin,ymin),(xmax, ymax),(255,0, 0),2)
    while 1:
     cv2.imshow("Frame",image)
     key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
     if key == ord("q"):
       break
   ```


NOTE: Now this lib just returns coordinate of the biggest face in the image. I will finish this when I can spare some time.
